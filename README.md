# Image Segmenation 
Straightforward implementation of UNET Architecture from "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for BiomedicalImage Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al.

Includes testing scripts, model architecture, data pre-processing, model training and inference.

TODO:
1. Test Data Pre-processing functions
2. Make training script with Lightning - Need to change torch model to lightning
3. Make inference script and show results - Log results with W&B
