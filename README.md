# Image Segmenation 
Straightforward implementation of UNET Architecture from "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for BiomedicalImage Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al.

Includes testing scripts, model architecture, data pre-processing, model training and inference.

TODO:
1. Finish sweep training script and test it
1.1. Setting Sweep configurations in sweep_config.yaml 
1.1 find other hparams to sweep over
2. Make inference script and show results - Log results with W&B
3. Check validation metrics which we are trying to optimise for
