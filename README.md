# Image Segmenation 
Straightforward implementation of UNET Architecture from "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for BiomedicalImage Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al.

Includes testing scripts, model architecture, data pre-processing, model training and inference.

TODO:

1. Add padding to architecture to preserve image size 
2. Change test according to 1.
3. Set up data pre-processing pipeline
4. Make training script with Lightning
5. Make inference test script to show results
