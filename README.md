# Image Segmenation 
Straightforward implementation of UNET Architecture from "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for BiomedicalImage Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al.

Includes testing scripts, model architecture, data pre-processing, model training and inference.

TODO:
1. Set up data pre-processing pipeline
2. Make training script with Lightning
3. Make inference test script to show results
